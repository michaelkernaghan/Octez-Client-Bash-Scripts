## üîß Setup & Configuration

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Octez-Client-Bash-Scripts
chmod +x *.sh
```

### 2. Configure Addresses
Edit `common.sh` with your addresses:
```bash
# Update these with your actual addresses
baker_address="tz1your_baker_address_here"
staker_addresses=(
    "tz1your_staker_address_1"
    "tz1your_staker_address_2"  
    "tz1your_staker_address_3"
)
```

### 3. Test Compatibility
```bash
./test-compatibility.sh
```

### 4. Run Scripts
```bash
# Monitor adaptive issuance
./adaptive_issuance.sh

# Check cycle timing
./time-to-next-cycle.sh

# Interactive unstaking workflow
./unstake-workflow.sh

# Native multisig management  
./native-multisig.sh
```

## üí° Seoul Protocol Features

### Native Multisig Accounts
Create and manage multisig accounts directly in the protocol:
```bash
./native-multisig.sh
# Interactive menu for:
# - Creating multisig accounts
# - Preparing transactions  
# - Collecting signatures
# - Executing transactions
```

### Enhanced Staking Operations
Seoul protocol provides improved staking with new commands:
```bash
# Check staking balances
octez-client get staked balance for <address>
octez-client get full balance for <address>

# Staking operations
octez-client stake <amount> for <delegate>
octez-client unstake <amount> for <delegate>  
octez-client finalize unstake for <delegate>
```

### Unstaking Workflow
Complete interactive unstaking process:
```bash
./unstake-workflow.sh
# Guided workflow including:
# - Setting staking limits
# - Unstaking procedures
# - Finalization timing
# - Fund transfers
```

## üìä Example Output

### Adaptive Issuance Monitoring
```bash
$ ./adaptive_issuance.sh

Cycle:850 Level:20971520
Baker: tz1hyVeFrkoDG1eFTaQZoYKC93hGUdRVes4D
Liquid balance: 15000.50 Íú©
Staked balance: 85000.75 Íú©  
Full balance: 100001.25 Íú©

Active Staking Parameters:
{
  "limit_of_staking_over_baking_millionth": 5000000,
  "edge_of_baking_over_staking_billionth": 150000000
}

Current Yearly Rate: 4.52%
Issuance Per Minute: 85.33 Íú©
Total Frozen Stake: 875,432,100.50 Íú©
```

### Cycle Timing (Seoul 10s Blocks)
```bash
$ ./time-to-next-cycle.sh

Cycle:850 Level:20971520
Levels done this cycle: 15360
Levels to next cycle: 9216
Minutes to next cycle: 1536  
Hours to next cycle: 25.6
```

## üîß Migration from Oxford

If upgrading from Oxford protocol, see `SEOUL_MIGRATION_NOTES.md` for:
- Timing calculation updates (15s ‚Üí 10s blocks)
- New staking command syntax
- Native multisig migration
- Compatibility testing procedures

```bash
# Test Seoul compatibility
./test-compatibility.sh
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command not found errors:**
```bash
# Ensure Octez is in PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/octez/bin
# Or create symlinks
ln -s /path/to/octez-client /usr/local/bin/
```

**Connection errors:**
```bash
# Check node status
octez-client rpc get /chains/main/blocks/head/helpers/current_level

# Verify network connection
octez-client config show
```

**Timing calculation errors:**
- Scripts automatically use Seoul constants (10s blocks, 24576 blocks/cycle)
- If using custom network, update `BLOCK_TIME_SECONDS` and `BLOCKS_PER_CYCLE` in `common.sh`

**Permission denied:**
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

### Getting Help

1. **Test compatibility first**: `./test-compatibility.sh`
2. **Check configuration**: Review addresses in `common.sh`
3. **Verify network**: Ensure node is synced and accessible
4. **Read migration notes**: `SEOUL_MIGRATION_NOTES.md`
